# Cellphone robot ROS Package quick tutorial
Welcome to cellphone robot project! This is part of [Project Cellphone robot](https://github.com/AGKhalil/Cellphone_Robot/wiki) and is mainly focused on the some extended functionalities, hardware control, as well as  message-passing between the android application and the ROS system resided on any linux system. In our project we decide to use [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/), a single-board computer with considerate computation power. Read [wiki](https://github.com/wang3303/ros_cellphonerobot/wiki) for concrete details.
## Step 1: Install ROS
* Follow the [link](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment) and configure the ROS environment. For instance you can build the catkin works space in `~/catkin_ws`.
* Type the following line in your terminal. Make sure 
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/wang3303/ros_cellphonerobot.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```
* Note: ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable includes the directory you're in. You should see something similar as below in your terminal.
```
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
/home/youruser/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/kinetic/share
```
## Step 2: Run the robot system using the following line:

```
$ roslaunch ros_cellphonerobot robot.launch
```

This will bring all the nodes online.

## Step 3: Change profiles in rosparam and set up your robot

You can modify the profile for your robot in `/ros_cellphonerobot/rosparam/profile.yaml`. The explanation for this file could be found [here](https://github.com/wang3303/ros_cellphonerobot/wiki/Resume).

## Step 4: Action publishing

You can run the following line to publish keys to `/action` topic for debugging. For instance, `w` could stand for moving forward. `a` could stand for moving backward.
```
$ rosrun ros_cellphonerobot key_publisher.py
```

## Step 5 (Optional): Image classification
* Install [Tensorflow](https://github.com/samjabrahams/tensorflow-on-raspberry-pi)
* Uncomment the node `image_classify.py` in `ros_cellphonerobot/`.
You can publish images to topic `/inception` 

+ *Important Note: `ros_inception.py` will download Neural Network weights and models the first time it runs. Hence, wait patiently until `ros_inception.py` successfully download necessary files. You can monitor downloading progress by output `ros_inception.py` to screen after modifying the launch file.*
```
<node pkg="ros_cellphonerobot" name="image_classify" type="image_classify.py" output="screen"/>
```
+ *Make sure you pass argument `--model_dir` and `--num_top_predictions` to this node as instructed [here](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/node)*.
